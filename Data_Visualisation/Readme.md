This sales database of a fictitious UK clothing business known as Threads Ltd. The company operates across the island through a network of retailers and chain stores.

The dataset

From the dataset, the orders table stores information related to sales orders carried out by Threads Ltd.
This includes the key financial information related to each order, such as the sales amount and the cost of goods sold - also known as COGS.
This variable indicates the direct costs associated with making the clothes the company sells. We also have the returns table that details
any orders that were returned after purchase due to errors or faults. There are also several dimension tables that we will be working with. 
The products table contains information related to the items of clothing that are manufactured by Threads Ltd. The retailers table holds all 
relevant data to the retailers that purchase the items - essentially, the company's customers.

Audience

Initial audience will be the Head of Sales of the company, who has a good understanding of the high-level figures related to the company's performance and the products they sell.
However, the Head of Sales does wish to investigate in more detail what type of orders the company is processing and what products are being ordered. The specific output 
requested will be tailored to her requirements as it is a special project she has asked you to perform.
